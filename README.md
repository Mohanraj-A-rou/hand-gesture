Gesture recognition, fall detection and stroke detection

GESTURE RECOGNITION:
 
# [Thumb, Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky] (Hold for 3 seconds)
| Finger Pattern    | Meaning           |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]` | Emergency (Thumb) |
| `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]` | Need Water / Food |
| `[0, 1, 0, 0, 0]` | Want Restroom     |
| `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]` | Want Medicine     |
| `[1, 0, 1, 1, 1]` | Adjust Position   |
| `[0, 1, 1, 0, 0]` | Call Caregiver    |
| `[1, 1, 1, 0, 0]` | Uncomfortable     |

FALL DETECTION:
If the person not in the area for 5 seconds

STORKE DETECTION USING FACIAL:
Identifies potential facial drooping, a common stroke indicator.
How it works: Measures vertical asymmetry between the left and right mouth corners relative to the nose. If asymmetry exceeds a defined threshold, a warning is shown
