ASSISTIVE SYSTEM FOR HEMIPLEGIC INDIVIDUALS

-->The system is for the Hemiplegia(paralysis on one side) with dysarthria(motor speech disorder) or aphasia(language disorder), this system includes,
-->Computer vision-based gesture recognition system, it used to contol the light and fans in the home(IoT), and it send the pre-defined commands to the caretaker by the gesture shown by hemilegic person.
       ->Pre-defined gesture commands for “Need Water/Food,Want Restroom, Want Medicine, Call Caregiver,Adjust Position, Uncomfortable”. On IoT gesture “Turn On/Off the light”.
-->While the patient lying on the bed, to monitor the fall and stroke detection the “Bed Pressure Sensor(Force Sensitive Resistors or Load Cells)” are used which detection and sends the message to the caretaker.
-->For monitoring the health of the patient the “Pulse Oximeter (SpO_2 sensor)” is used, where the heart rate and the oxygen level are monitored regularly.
-->While the patient is on the wheelchair, the movement of the wheelchair are controlled via a smartphone app by the patient. The movement may include  “Start/ forward, Stop, Turn left/ Turn right, Reverse, Emergency (Hand Break) -> High Priority”.
        ->On the wheelchair the “Ultrasonic Sensor” is used for the obstacle detection, where the obstacle are detect on certain distance the wheelchair may stop and it has high priority.
        ->For the fall detection of the wheelchair the “Accelerometer/Gyroscope (IMU)” is used.
-->For the high emergency the physical button is placed on the wheelchair and near the bed which send a "CRITICAL HELP NEEDED" message to the caretaker immediately.
